Imports

All Imports: Import prices decreased 0.3 percent in May, the largest monthly drop since the index fell 0.5 
percent in February 2016. The decline was driven by falling fuel prices, unlike last month when higher 
nonfuel prices more than offset decreasing fuel prices. The price index for U.S. imports rose 2.1 percent for 
the 12 months ended in May. The last over-the-year decline in import prices was a 0.2-percent decrease in 
October 2016.

Fuel Imports: Prices for fuel fell 3.7 percent in May following a 0.3-percent drop in April and a 3.1-percent 
decrease in March. The last time fuel prices fell by more than 3.7 percent was a 6.8-percent decline in 
February 2016. The May decrease was primarily led by a 3.9-percent drop in petroleum prices. Natural gas 
prices also declined, falling 2.9 percent. Despite the recent decreases, import fuel prices increased 16.9 
percent between May 2016 and May 2017. The import price index for petroleum advanced 16.2 percent for 
the year ended in May and natural gas prices rose 44.1 percent.                           

All Imports Excluding Fuel: The nonfuel import price index recorded no change in May following a 0.8-
percent advance over the previous 3 months. Lower prices for nonfuel industrial supplies and materials 
offset price increases for foods, feeds, and beverages, and automotive vehicles. Capital goods prices and 
prices for consumer goods recorded no change in May. Nonfuel prices advanced 0.8 percent over the past 
12 months, continuing the trend of over-the-year increases since November when the index fell 0.2 percent. 
Rising prices for nonfuel industrial supplies and materials; foods, feeds, and beverages; and automotive 
vehicles more than offset lower prices for capital goods and consumer goods over the past year.
