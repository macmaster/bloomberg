Exports:

All Exports: The price index for overall exports fell 0.7 percent in May following increases of 0.2 percent 
in each of the previous 2 months. The May decrease was the first monthly drop since August 2016 when the 
index declined 0.8 percent. Prices for agricultural and nonagricultural exports contributed to the overall drop 
in export prices. The price index for U.S. exports rose 1.4 percent for the year ended in May.                                  

Agricultural Exports: Prices for agricultural exports declined 1.6 percent in May, the first monthly 
decrease since a 0.2-percent drop in December. In May, decreasing prices for vegetables and fruit more than 
offset rising prices for soybeans, meat, wheat and corn. Prices for vegetable exports fell 24.9 percent in 
May, the largest monthly decline since February 1998 when the index fell 26.1 percent. Despite the May 
decline, agricultural export prices ticked up 0.1 percent over the past 12 months. Higher prices for 
vegetables, meats, and nuts all contributed to the rise in agricultural prices between May 2016 and May 
2017.

All Exports Excluding Agriculture: Nonagricultural export prices decreased 0.6 percent in May, led by 
falling prices for nonagricultural industrial supplies and materials which more than offset higher prices for 
both capital goods and consumer goods. Export prices for automotive vehicles recorded no change in May. 
The price index for nonagricultural exports rose over the past year, increasing 1.5 percent.
